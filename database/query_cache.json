    "Can I get a child plan, and what documents do I need to claim?": "You can get a child plan, which is designed to build savings for a child's future needs, such as education, while often providing life cover for the parent or policyholder. To claim under a child plan, you will typically need to provide several documents, including the policy document, proof of the child's age and identity, and proof of the policyholder's death or other claim-triggering event. Additionally, you may need to submit a claim form, the original policy, death certificate, and ID proof of the beneficiary. \n\nIn some cases, medical reports or accident reports may also be required, depending on the circumstances of the claim. It's essential to review your policy documents to understand the specific requirements for claiming under your child plan, as these may vary by insurer and policy terms. Once you have all the necessary documents, you can initiate the claim process, which is typically processed within 15 to 30 days, although complex claims may take longer. To avoid delays or rejections, ensure you have all the necessary documents ready before submitting your claim."
